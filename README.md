# Terraform
## What is terraform and how can it help you manage infrastructure as code? 

Terraform is the infrastructure as a code offering from HashiCorp. It is a tool for building, changing and managing infrastructure in a safe, repeatable way. Operators and Infrastructure teams can use Terraform to manage environments with a configuration language called the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) for human-readable, automated deployments.

Terraform works with over 160 different providers for a broad set of common infrastructure. Provider SDK makes it simple to create new and custom providers. Providers leverage infrastructure-specific APIs to preserve unique capabilities for each provider.

## Advantages of Terraform
- Infrastructure as Code: Define and manage infrastructure using code.

- Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Support: Works across various cloud providers.

- Infrastructure Consistency and Standardization: Ensures consistent configurations across environments.

- Automation and Efficiency: Automates infrastructure provisioning and management tasks.

- Dependency Management and Resource Graph: Handles complex resource dependencies intelligently.

- State Management: Tracks and manages infrastructure state for accurate updates.

- Modularity and Reusability: Encourages code reuse through modular components.

- Auditing and Compliance: Provides visibility and tracking of infrastructure changes.

### Infrastructure as a Code
Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface. IaC allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.

Terraform is HashiCorp's infrastructure as a code tool. It lets you define resources and infrastructure in human-readable, declarative configuration files and manages your infrastructure's lifecycle.

Using Terraform has several advantages over manually managing your infrastructure:

Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms.

The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly.

Terraform's state allows you to track resource changes throughout your deployments.

You can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure.

## Why do we need Terraform and how does it simplify infrastructure provisioning?
Terraform simplifies infrastructure provisioning by automating tasks, leveraging code-based configurations, supporting multi-cloud environments, providing consistency, managing infrastructure state, handling dependencies, and offering preview capabilities for change validation.

Here are the reasons why we need Terraform and how it simplifies infrastructure provisioning:

- Automation: Enables automated infrastructure provisioning, reducing manual effort.

- Infrastructure as Code: Defines and manages infrastructure using code, facilitating versioning and collaboration.

- Multi-Cloud Support: Works with various cloud providers, simplifying management in multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments.

- Consistent Workflow: Provides a consistent approach to provisioning infrastructure across different environments.

- Infrastructure State Management: Keeps track of the infrastructure state, making it easier to update and modify resources.

- Dependency Management: Automatically manages resource dependencies, ensuring the correct order of operations.

- Plan and Preview: Generates execution plans for changes, allowing review before applying them.
